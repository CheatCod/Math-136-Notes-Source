\section{Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ }

\textbf{Definition:} Vector

\begin{tcolorbox}
\emph{A vector is an object that has both magnitude and direction.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Representation I:} Geometrically


Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbb{R}^3$ and even in $\mathbb{R}^n$
can we visualized as directed line segments.

Vectors can be move around in $\mathbb{R}^n$ space as long as their magnitude
and direction is not changed, that is, the vectors are not localized
Points and vectors are not the same.

\medskip

\textbf{Representation II:} Algebraically
Vectors can be expressed as columns of numbers. These columns are often called \emph{n-\textbf{tuples}}

\[
    \vec{w} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        2 \\
        3
    \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R} ^ 2,
    \vec{v} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        -3 \\
        1 \\
        -5
    \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R} ^3,
    \vec{x} = 
    \begin{pmatrix} 
        x_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        x_n
    \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R} ^ n,
\]

\medskip

\textbf{Notation:}
\[
    \vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\
        2 \\
        3 \\
        4 \\
        5 \\

    \end{pmatrix} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)^T
\]
where "T" is short for transpose and must be included

\medskip

\textbf{Relationship between a point and a vector:}

Let $\vec{p}$ be a vector in $\mathbb{R} ^ n$ which then could be thought of as 
a discrete line segment per \textbf{Representation I}. Let \emph{P} be the terminal point of
$\vec{p}$, thus $\vec{p}$ can be written as 

\[
  \vec{p} = \begin{pmatrix}
      a_1 \\
      a_2 \\
      \vdots \\
      a_n
  \end{pmatrix}  
\]
then the point P has the coordinates $(a_1, a_2, ... a_n)$.

The vector $\vec{v}$ from the origin to p has the same set of number as P. 
It is P's positional vector

\medskip

\textbf{Vector Equality: }

Let $\vec{v}$ = $(v_1, v_2...v_n)^T$ and $\vec{w}$ = $(w_1, w_2...w_n)^T$

$\vec{v}$ = $\vec{w}$ if

1. Same mag + dir

2. $\forall i = 1, 2 ... n, \vec{v}_i = \vec{w}_i$
